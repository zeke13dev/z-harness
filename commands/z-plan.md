description: Run the rigorous z-harness planning pipeline — challenge premises, batch decisions, cross-consult Gemini + Codex once, and produce SPEC.md / PLAN.md / TASKS.md.
argument-hint: <feature or task description>
---

You are running the **z-harness `/z-plan`** pipeline.

Task (from `$ARGUMENTS`):

$ARGUMENTS

**If the task above is empty or whitespace**, do this first: use `AskUserQuestion` (or a direct question if a free-text answer is needed) to ask the user "What task should I plan?". Wait for their reply. Treat their reply as the task and continue. Do not proceed past this point without a concrete task description.

Strict, multi-phase. Do not skip phases. Do not write production code — `/z-plan` produces planning artifacts only; implementation happens later via `/z-implement-next`.

## Setup

1. **Derive a plan slug** from the task: short kebab-case, 2-4 words (e.g. "expand sports ML" → `expand-sports-ml`; "add rate limit middleware" → `add-rate-limit`). Check for existing slug dirs in the canonical plans directory (`z-harness/plans/`) and the legacy directory (`z-harness/`). If a matching slug dir is found:
   - **Precontext-only slug dir** (only `BRAINSTORM.md` and/or `RESEARCH.md` present, no `PLAN.md`/`SPEC.md`/`TASKS.md`): treat as continuation — no prompt, proceed with the existing slug.
   - **Finished-plan slug dir** (`PLAN.md` or `TASKS.md` exists): collision — prompt the user via `AskUserQuestion` to confirm or choose a different slug.
   If the auto-derived slug is non-obvious, confirm with the user via `AskUserQuestion`.
2. **Export** `Z_HARNESS_SLUG=<slug>` and `Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR=$(bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plan-path.sh" resolve_plan_path "$Z_HARNESS_SLUG")` for all subsequent shell calls and subagents — this is what namespaces every output path.
3. Pick a run id: `RUN=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-<slug>`
4. `mkdir -p $Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/transcripts`
5. Capture the z-harness plugin version stamp and log the run start (merge version blob into the payload):
   ```bash
   VERSION_BLOB="$(bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/version.sh")"
   START_PAYLOAD="$(python3 -c '
   import json, sys
   v = json.loads(sys.argv[1]); v["task"] = sys.argv[2]
   print(json.dumps(v))
   ' "$VERSION_BLOB" "<arguments>")"
   bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" run_start "$START_PAYLOAD"
   ```
   Output lands under `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/events.jsonl` (log-event.sh honors `Z_HARNESS_SLUG`).
   Then log provider resolution (once per run, guarded against re-emission):
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/.providers-logged" ]; then
     bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-providers.sh" || true
     mkdir -p "$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN"
     touch "$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/.providers-logged"
   fi
   ```
6. Notification policy: read env `Z_HARNESS_NOTIFY` (default `approval_only`). Values: `off`, `approval_only`, `all`.
7. **Check for LLM-tier docs.** If `docs/llm/INDEX.json` exists in the repo root, **do NOT read it from main thread.** Note its existence; Phase 1 will dispatch `doc-fetcher` (Haiku) to read it. The orchestrator never reads `docs/llm/*.json` directly — that's what burns main-thread context unnecessarily. If INDEX.json does not exist, note that fact and continue (Phase 1 will Explore without doc grounding).
8. **Docs-freshness route gate.** If `docs/llm/INDEX.json` exists, compute staleness across all its entries before Phase 1 starts. This step is the ONE exception where main thread reads INDEX.json — but only the lightweight metadata fields (`slug`, `last_updated`, `source_file`), never the per-concept `<slug>.json` bodies. For each concept entry, compare `entry.last_updated` against the max `mtime` of its `source_files`. A concept is **stale** if any source file's mtime exceeds `last_updated`. Compute `stale_pct = stale_concepts / total_concepts`. The threshold is `$Z_HARNESS_DOC_STALENESS_THRESHOLD` (default `20` — meaning 20 percent). If `stale_pct >= threshold`, handle it through the route-decision flow before Phase 1: write `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/route-decision.md`, emit `plan_route_decision` with `from_command: "/z-plan"`, `to_command: "/z-maintain-docs"`, `route_class: "contextual"`, `reason_codes: ["docs_stale"]`, `signals.docs_stale_or_drifted: true`, `confidence: "high"`, `classifier_used: false`, `artifact_path`, `route_chain`, and the eventual `user_choice`, then push-notify and present the AskUser handoff gate: switch to `/z-maintain-docs`, continue here with stale docs, or abandon. Do not execute `/z-maintain-docs` automatically. If the user continues with stale docs, emit a `doc_drift_acknowledged` event and continue — Phase 1 still uses INDEX.json but the orchestrator should weight `relevant_concepts` hints less and verify against current code more aggressively.
9. **Pre-plan artifact detection.** Check `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/` for `BRAINSTORM.md` and `RESEARCH.md`.
    - **Freshness check (RESEARCH.md only):** If `RESEARCH.md` exists, parse all file citations using regex `/[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.(rs|py|md|ts|tsx|js|jsx|json|toml|yaml|yml|sh|sql)(:\d+(-\d+)?)?/`. Also scan for extensionless allowlist filenames (`Makefile`, `Dockerfile`). Markdown link form `[label](path:line)` — extract the inner path. For each cited path: follow symlinks; compare mtime to `generated_at`; for line-ranges, use min-line mtime (any modification within range → stale). If any stale citation found, warn the user via `AskUserQuestion` ("proceed with stale research" / "re-run research" / "abort"). Deleted-source detection: if a cited file no longer exists, emit a `precontext_source_deleted` event (higher severity than stale-mtime) **and** trigger the same `AskUserQuestion` warn path — deleted-source citations are treated as stale for the purposes of the user gate. Parse failure: emit `precontext_freshness_check_failed`, continue (fail-open).
    - **Conflict check:** If both `BRAINSTORM.md` and `RESEARCH.md` exist, scan for obvious contradictions (e.g. Brainstorm assumes X is possible; Research found constraint Y that prevents it). Surface contradictions to the user.
    - **Unfinalized brainstorm:** If `BRAINSTORM.md` is present but `status: complete` is missing or `chosen_framing` is absent, recommend the user run `/z-brainstorm` again before proceeding.

**All paths in subsequent phases live under `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/`:**
- `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/SPEC.md`
- `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/PLAN.md`
- `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/TASKS.md`
- `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/<run-id>/...`

Multiple slugs can coexist (parallel plans). The repo-wide `z-harness/metrics.jsonl` aggregates events across all slugs with a `slug` field in each event.

Each phase below ends with a checkpoint — write the phase's output to `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/<phase>.md` so the run is resumable.

<!-- PLAN_ROUTE_CHECK_START -->
## Plan Route Check

Run this route check after Setup step 9's precontext/docs gates and before Phase 1 dispatch, then run it again after Phase 5 approval if the decisions or estimated task shape make split risk clear. Use only already-known signals: `candidate_files`, `expected_tasks`, `non_obvious_decisions`, `cluster_seams`, `cross_module`, `schema_or_persistence`, `public_api_or_wire_format`, `terrain_uncertain`, `approach_uncertain`, `has_bug_diagnosis`, `has_unknown_bug_symptom`, `has_existing_plan`, `has_fix_artifact`, and `docs_stale_or_drifted`.

Deterministic routes:
- Route tiny implementation-only work (`candidate_files <= 3`, no non-obvious decisions, no cross-module/schema/public surface impact) to `/z-do`.
- Route small targeted fixes (`candidate_files <= 5`, `non_obvious_decisions <= 2`, no public API/schema impact) to `/z-plan-light`; if the task is a diagnosed bug, use contextual `/z-fix`, and if it is an unknown bug symptom, use contextual `/z-debug`.
- Stay in `/z-plan` for coherent medium changes, especially `expected_tasks <= 25` with no clear independent cluster seams.
- Route large or independently separable work to `/z-plan-split` when `expected_tasks > 25` or `cluster_seams` is in `2..6`.
- Route unknown terrain or missing citations to `/z-research`; route multiple plausible framings with sufficient terrain to `/z-brainstorm`.
- Recommend contextual `/z-audit-plan` only after `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md` exist; use `/z-amend` when the user is changing an existing plan, and `/z-maintain-docs` when doc drift blocks confidence.

Call `planning-router` only when deterministic signals conflict and no hard threshold already decides the route. It receives the compact signal payload plus the current route chain and is advisory; malformed or unavailable classifier output falls back to deterministic routing or an AskUser choice.

If routing, write `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/route-decision.md`, emit `plan_route_decision` with `from_command`, `to_command`, `route_class`, `reason_codes`, `signals`, `confidence`, `classifier_used`, `artifact_path`, `route_chain`, and `user_choice`, then present the AskUser handoff gate: switch, continue when not forbidden by a hard threshold, or abandon. Do not execute the next command automatically.

Loop prevention: carry forward the latest route chain; if it already has two entries, ask the user to choose explicitly. If the recommended target equals the immediate prior `from_command`, block ping-pong, show both route artifacts, and ask the user to choose. If the user continues here, log the override and do not route again for the same `reason_codes` in this run.
<!-- PLAN_ROUTE_CHECK_END -->

## Phase telemetry (mandatory)

At the **start** of each phase (0 through 9), record `T0=$(date +%s%3N)`. At the **end**, log:

```bash
WALL_MS=$(( $(date +%s%3N) - T0 ))
bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" phase_end \
  "$(printf '{"phase":%d,"name":"%s","wall_ms":%d,"user_wait_ms":%d}' \
     <phase-num> "<phase-name>" "$WALL_MS" "$USER_WAIT_MS_THIS_PHASE")"
```

If the phase blocks on `AskUserQuestion`, separately log `user_wait_start` / `user_wait_end` events bracketing that wait so we can compute machine-time vs human-wait-time after the fact:

```bash
bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" user_wait_start '{"phase":<n>,"reason":"<short>"}'
# ... AskUserQuestion ...
bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" user_wait_end '{"phase":<n>,"wall_ms":<delta>}'
```

This makes post-run analysis trivial: total run time = sum(`phase_end.wall_ms`); machine time = that minus sum(`user_wait_end.wall_ms`); per-LLM costs already covered by the existing `consult` events.

---

## Phase 0 — Premise check

**Do not take the prompt's premises for granted.** If `BRAINSTORM.md` or `RESEARCH.md` were detected in Setup step 9, **inject their content here** as input to the premise check (extracting core hypothesis + findings). Do not re-derive context already covered by these artifacts.

Before any planning, ask:

- Does the stated goal actually solve the underlying problem? (e.g. if the user asks for a faster cache, is caching even the right answer?)
- Will the proposed approach actually work? (e.g. for a quant strategy: is the edge real, will it survive transaction costs, is the backtest leaking? for an architecture: will it scale to the stated load?)
- Is there a materially better path the user hasn't considered?

If any of these surface a real concern, **stop and raise it with the user before moving on.** Do not plan around a flawed premise. Use `AskUserQuestion` if there's a structured choice.

If nothing concerning surfaces, write a one-paragraph "premise accepted, here's what I take the goal to be" summary so the user can correct your read.

Checkpoint: `phase0-premise.md`.

## Phase 1 — Exploration

**RESEARCH.md shortcut:** If RESEARCH.md was detected (Setup step 9) and is non-stale, it may make doc-fetcher and/or Explore optional. The two skip conditions are **independent** — evaluate each separately:

- **Skip doc-fetcher** iff RESEARCH.md is non-stale AND its `Findings:` section has ≥1 entry citing a file in the task's likely-touched set.
- **Skip Explore** iff RESEARCH.md is non-stale AND its `Open questions:` section is empty.

The four resulting cases:
- **(a) Skip doc-fetcher only** — RESEARCH.md has findings for touched files but has open questions → run Explore, skip doc-fetcher.
- **(b) Skip Explore only** — RESEARCH.md has no findings for touched files but has no open questions → run doc-fetcher, skip Explore.
- **(c) Skip both** — RESEARCH.md has findings for touched files AND no open questions → skip both, proceed to Phase 2.
- **(d) Run both** — RESEARCH.md is stale, absent, or meets neither skip condition → run both doc-fetcher and Explore.

**Rule: doc-fetcher FIRST, Explore for gaps.** The two-tier docs at `docs/llm/` are a cheap pre-built oracle. The orchestrator must consult them via the `doc-fetcher` (Haiku) subagent before dispatching the (expensive) Explore subagent.

### 1a. Dispatch doc-fetcher (if INDEX.json exists)

If Setup step 7 noted `docs/llm/INDEX.json` exists, spawn ONE `doc-fetcher` call with the task's keywords:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="doc-fetcher",
  description="Doc context for <slug>",
  prompt="query: <one-sentence summary of the task>\nrepo_root: <abs path>\ndepth: standard"
)
```

It returns a tight synthesis: matched concepts, key files with line ranges, invariants. If it returns `STATUS: no_docs` or `STATUS: no_match`, proceed to Explore with no grounding. If it returns `STATUS: partial`, Explore must fill the gap it named.

If a `DRIFT WARNING` block appears in the return, log a `doc_drift` event per affected slug:
```bash
bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" doc_drift \
  '{"concept":"<slug>","claim":"<what doc said>","reality":"<what code says>","file":"<path>"}'
```

### 1b. Explore for gaps (Haiku by default)

Now identify what doc-fetcher did NOT cover (or what's absent entirely if no docs exist): touched files, reusable patterns, constraints, adjacent code that could regress.

**Explore is dispatched with `model: "haiku"` by default.** Pass it the doc-fetcher synthesis as scaffolding so it doesn't re-derive what we already have:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description="Find <thing> related to <slug>",
  prompt="<TARGETED question that fills a specific gap from doc-fetcher>\n\nAlready known (from doc-fetcher): <paste tight summary>\n\nFocus only on what is NOT covered above."
)
```

**When to upgrade Explore to Sonnet:** if the question requires *interpretation* (e.g. "explain the control flow of X" rather than "where is X defined"), upgrade by setting `model: "sonnet"`. Locating > Sonnet. Interpreting > Sonnet. Default > Haiku.

**Cap `Explore` subagent dispatches at 3 total per `/z-plan` run.** Each Explore (even Haiku) is a repo-mapping pass that consumes meaningful cache-read context. In the data-overhaul run, 5 Opus Explores ate 13.9 M tokens — ~93% of the entire planning budget. Haiku materially cuts that, but the cap stays: if 3 is not enough, prefer direct Read/Grep/Glob from the orchestrator over a 4th Explore. Override via `Z_HARNESS_MAX_EXPLORE=N` only with explicit user request.

Output a one-paragraph context summary. Checkpoint: `phase1-context.md`.

## Phase 2 — Decisions document

Enumerate **every** decision needed to implement this task — obvious and non-obvious. Write `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/decisions.md`. For each decision:

- **Decision:** what's being decided
- **Options:** ≥1 candidate, with one-line tradeoffs
- **Tentative call:** your current pick
- **Consult? (yes/no):** apply the rules below
- **Trigger:** which rule made it consult-worthy (if yes)

### Consultation rules

A decision is **non-obvious (consult)** if *any* applies:

- Introduces a new external dependency
- Defines or changes a public API / module boundary / wire format
- Picks an algorithm or data structure where Big-O or memory differ between candidates
- Touches concurrency, shared state, or ordering guarantees
- Touches persistence: schema, migration, indexes, retention
- Names something on a public surface (hard to rename later)
- Affects >1 module or crosses a layer boundary
- **Reversibility:** if wrong, >1 hour to undo
- **Articulation:** you can name ≥2 candidate options with materially different tradeoffs

A decision is **obvious (skip consult)** if:
- Following an existing convention in the same file/module
- Local variable naming, internal helper structure
- Mechanical refactor with no behavior change
- Bug fix with root cause already identified

## Phase 2.5 — User gate

Show `decisions.md` to the user. They are the gate:
- Can flip any decision's consult flag
- Can override your tentative call
- Can kill scope

**Hard cap: 5 consult-flagged decisions per bundle.** If more, ask the user to pick the top 5 or split the plan into multiple `/z-plan` runs.

Block here until the user has approved the decisions doc. Send a `PushNotification` if policy is `approval_only` or `all`.

## Phase 3 — Bundled cross-LLM consultation

Spawn **both** consultants in parallel in a single message:

- `Agent(subagent_type="consultant-primary", ...)`
- `Agent(subagent_type="consultant-secondary", ...)`

Each gets the **entire approved decisions doc** with the consult-flagged decisions highlighted. They can see all decisions and flag interactions between them. Two calls total, regardless of feature size.

When both return:
1. For each recommendation, articulate **one concrete reason it might be wrong** before accepting it. This is mechanical, not optional.
2. Synthesize. Make the final call yourself, citing which inputs you weighed.
3. Flag any shortcut over the robust long-lasting solution — requires explicit user approval in Phase 5.

Save transcripts (the consultants do this themselves). Checkpoint: `phase3-decisions-final.md`.

## Phase 4 — Final clarifications

If anything is still unclear about scope, constraints, or success criteria — ask the user. No silent assumptions.

## Phase 5 — Present + approve

If notification policy ≠ `off`, send a `PushNotification`: "Decisions ready for review."

Present a **concise** decisions summary: one bullet per decision (what, why, what was rejected). Separate **Shortcuts** section: what's being skipped, robust alternative, cost of the shortcut.

Use `AskUserQuestion` for explicit approval on:
- Each major design decision
- Each proposed shortcut (default to robust if not approved)

Block until answered.

## Phase 6 — Write SPEC.md and PLAN.md

Create `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/SPEC.md` — per-file detailed spec: paths, exported surface, signatures, behavior, invariants, edge cases, error handling.

The SPEC.md must include a `## Planning Inputs` section near the top (after title/overview, before any per-file sections) listing which precontext artifacts contributed to this plan:

```markdown
## Planning Inputs

| Artifact | Path | generated_at |
|----------|------|--------------|
| BRAINSTORM.md | $Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/BRAINSTORM.md | <iso timestamp or "n/a"> |
| RESEARCH.md | $Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/RESEARCH.md | <iso timestamp or "n/a"> |
```

If neither artifact was present, write: `none — fresh /z-plan run.`

Create `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/PLAN.md` — approved plan: goals, decisions (with rationale), non-goals, approved shortcuts, ordered phases.

Both obey **DRY / KISS / SOLID**. State explicitly how the plan respects each.

## Phase 7 — Bundled final review

Spawn both consultants in parallel, each handed the full SPEC.md + PLAN.md:
- consultant-primary: "Critique this plan. What's wrong, missing, or fragile?"
- consultant-secondary: same.

Apply findings that hold up under "one reason this might be wrong" scrutiny. Push back on the rest with documented reasoning.

## Phase 8 — TASKS.md

Create `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/TASKS.md`. Break PLAN.md into small, independently-implementable tasks. Each: `T001`-style ID, title, files touched, dependencies, acceptance criteria, status `[ ]`. Size so each fits a fresh context window.

**Task-count discipline.** Target **10–20 tasks**. If you produced **>25** tasks, stop and ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:
- "Combine 2-3 tasks I'll suggest" (you propose candidate merges)
- "Ship as-is — this plan really is that big"
- "Restructure — let me redesign Phase 8"

Sweet spot: each task fits one fresh context window AND produces ~50–500 lines of diff. Too many micro-tasks = orchestration overhead dominates; too few mega-tasks = bad failure isolation.

**Remote-verify tags.** For any task that touches Rust crates or Python scripts intended for the remote host, append a `**REMOTE_VERIFY:** <cargo command>` line to the task block. Example:
```
**REMOTE_VERIFY:** cargo check -p strategies-sports-ml-mispricing
```
The orchestrator dispatches a `remote-runner` (Haiku) to rsync+build in the sandbox; failure halts the task before review.

**Docs-touched flag.** For any task that touches a user-facing surface (CLI flags, public APIs, configs, schemas), append a `**DOCS:** <concept-slug>` line. This is a hint for `/z-maintain-docs`; not a rigid task on its own.

**Complexity stamp (parallel Haiku classifier).** After writing all task blocks, dispatch the `complexity-classifier` (Haiku) subagent once per task **in parallel** (single message, multiple `Agent()` calls). Each call passes the verbatim task block, `spec_slice_path: $BASE/SPEC.md`, and `repo_root`. Parse each return's `TIER:` and `REASON:` lines, then `Edit` TASKS.md to append a `**Complexity:** <tier>` line to the matching task block. Log a `task_classified` event per task:
```bash
bash "${ANTIGRAVITY_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log-event.sh" "$RUN" task_classified \
  "$(printf '{"task":"%s","tier":"%s","reason":%s}' "<task-id>" "<tier>" "$(printf '%s' "<reason>" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))')")"
```
If a task block already contains a user-authored `**Complexity:** <tier>` line (rare at plan-time, but possible if the user is editing TASKS.md in-flight), the classifier returns `REASON: user-authored override` and you leave the stamp alone. The orchestrator `/z-implement-all` reads this stamp at dispatch time to pick the implementer model (`low|medium` → Sonnet, `high` → Opus).

## Phase 9 — Finalize archive

Copy `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/{SPEC,PLAN,TASKS}.md` into `$Z_HARNESS_PLAN_DIR/archive/$RUN/`. Update `manifest.json` with end timestamp, status `complete`, totals (decision count, consultation count, total tokens if available).

Log run end. Send a `PushNotification` if policy ≠ `off` with FOUR recommendations:
```
Plan complete. <N> tasks queued.

Recommended:
  /compact          — free planning context before next phase
  /z-audit-plan     — (recommended) audit spec & tasks against codebase reality and best practices
  /z-test           — (optional, recommended for risky / financial code) draft semantic test cases before implementation
  /z-implement-all  — orchestrate the queue (auto-includes TESTS.md if present, or /z-implement-next for one-at-a-time)
```

The `/compact` recommendation is important: the planning phase (Explore agents, decisions doc, consultant returns, SPEC/PLAN drafting) is the heaviest context burner in the harness. Compacting at this boundary frees ~MB of main-thread context before implementation kicks off. Subagents during implementation are fresh-context already, so no per-batch compact is needed.

The `/z-test` step is optional but high-value when the plan touches money, ordering, signal generation, or any other domain where mechanical correctness (which `/z-implement-all`'s reviewer catches) is not enough to catch semantic bugs (notional sign flips, feature schema mismatches, unit confusion). It produces a `TESTS.md` artifact that `/z-implement-all`'s implementer subagent reads alongside TASKS.md, so test code lands in the same diff as the production code it exercises.

---

## Operating principles

- **Premise first.** Challenge the request before planning around it.
- **Push back is structural** — every accepted recommendation needs an articulated "reason it might be wrong" before you accept it.
- **Always ask** when unclear.
- **Shortcuts only with explicit approval.**
- **DRY / KISS / SOLID** are non-negotiable.
- **Log everything.** Every consultation, approval, pushback, error — via `scripts/log-event.sh`.
